# hdlbits-verilog-progress
My solutions to HDLBits Verilog problems.  
Module declarations are made using ANSI-style (Verilog-2001) port declarations.  
Quartus project files and backups are not included, only Verilog HDL files.  
Subfolders are organized according to HDLBits problem set organization, not including "Getting Started".
