# hdlbits-verilog-progress
My solutions to HDLBits Verilog problems.
Some tweaks are made to prevent errors in Quartus II that would not normally occur in HDLBits virtual compiler and simulation.
Module declarations are made using ANSI-style (Verilog-2001) port declaration.
Quartus project files and backups are not included, only Verilog HDL files.
Subfolders are organized according to HDLBits problem set organization. Skipped "Getting Started".
